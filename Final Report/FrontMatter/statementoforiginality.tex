    \item I have read and understood the ECS Academic Integrity information and the Universityâ€™s Academic Integrity Guidance for Students.
    \item I am aware that failure to act in accordance with the Regulations Governing Academic Integrity may lead to the imposition of penalties which, for the most serious cases, may include termination of programme.

\end{itemize}

We expect you to acknowledge all sources of information (e.g. ideas, algorithms, data) using citations. You must also put quotation marks around any sections of text that you have copied without paraphrasing. If any figures or tables have been taken or modified from another source, you must explain this in the caption and cite the original source.

\textbf{I have acknowledged all sources, and identified any content taken from elsewhere.}

If you have used any code (e.g. open-source code), reference designs, or similar resources that have been produced by anyone else, you must list them in the box below. In the report, you must explain what was used and how it relates to the work you have done.

The JavaScript React library \href{https://www.ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/getting-started/}{\texttt{ag-grid-react}} was used to implement the table fiew for the application.

\textbf{I have not used any resources produced by anyone else.}

You can consult with module teaching staff/demonstrators, but you should not show anyone else your work (this includes uploading your work to publicly-accessible repositories e.g. Github, unless expressly permitted by the module leader), or help them to do theirs. For individual assignments, we expect you to work on your own. For group assignments, we expect that you work only with your allocated group. You must get permission in writing from the module teaching staff before you seek outside assistance, e.g. a proofreading service, and declare it here.

\textbf{I did all the work myself, or with my allocated group, and have not helped anyone else.}

We expect that you have not fabricated, modified or distorted any data, evidence, references, experimental results, or other material used or presented in the report. You must clearly describe your experiments and how the results were obtained, and include all data, source code and/or designs (either in the report, or submitted as a separate file) so that your results could be reproduced.

\textbf{The material in the report is genuine, and I have included all my data/code/designs.}

We expect that you have not previously submitted any part of this work for another assessment. You must get permission in writing from the module teaching staff before re-using any of your previously submitted work for this assessment.

\textbf{I have not submitted any part of this work for another assessment.}

If your work involved research/studies (including surveys) on human participants, their cells or data, or on animals, you must have been granted ethical approval before the work was carried out, and any experiments must have followed these requirements. You must give details of this in the report, and list the ethical approval reference number(s) in the box below.

\textbf{My work did not involve human participants, their cells or data, or animals.}
