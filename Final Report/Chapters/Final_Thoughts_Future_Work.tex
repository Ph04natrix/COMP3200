\chapter{TODO: Conclusion (250 words)}% Treat this as a continuation of the introduction, sumarising all the prior sections.

%* This is under the Lessons Learned heading in Notion

\section{Future Work}
\subsection{User-Requested Features}
[-] Buffer zone for songs that have been recently listened to
    [-] added/viewable in collection but show that they aren't fully part of the collection yet
    [-] if this grows too much might come across the issue of people not wanting to deal with it.
    [-] need to be careful to figure out how to make it actually useful and not overwhelming for a user
    [-] how does this relate to song suggestions? are they one and the same or close enough??

\subsubsection{Customisable Presets: Attribute Combinatinos}
Thiis feature would help to handle the significantly large scale in the possible combinations of attributes for the static cartesian graphs.
    [-] require a lot of research into the different shapes and distributions that appear for all combinations
    [-] need a largre varied data set
    [-] possibly have to find an algorithm or automatable way to see if a distribution might be more useful than another
    [-] need to build a ranking list effectively of all the combinations

\subsection{Further Research}
[-] Rendering listening history
[-] Auto-generating Playlists, possibly using song tags as a base
[-] Adding Song tags
    [-] explicit is an example of a pre-existing tag, however there is a lot of complexity involved with letting users create and add tags.
    [-] would have to research into how iTunes did their tags and what went well and what didn't (Obsidian and any others as well)
    [-] automatic tag adding is desired for adding tags to a high volume of songs
    [-] make them hierarchical like the way genre works?
[-] Figuring out how to make this research more mobile friendly as more people listen using their phones\cite{} %todo CITE
