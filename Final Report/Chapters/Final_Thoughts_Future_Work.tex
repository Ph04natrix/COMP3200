\section{Future Work}
[-] Auto-generating Playlists, possibly using song tags as a base
[-] Buffer zone for songs that have been rrecently listened to
    [-] added/viewable in collection but show that they aren't fully part of the collection yet
    [-] if this grows too much might come across the issue of people not wanting to deal with it.
    [-] need to be careful to figure out how to make it actually useful and not overwhelming for a user
    [-] how does this relate to song suggestions? are they one and the same or close enough??
[-] Rendering listening history
