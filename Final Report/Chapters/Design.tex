%? Is this redundant
The instrument for testing and evaluation these new models of digital music collection organisation and song queue creation was decided to be a software application.

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
This software application was designed with the following guidelines in mind:\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{
        Integration with existing software
    } \(\to\) the features in the application should be able to be inserted in existing music streaming applications without issue (such as Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) %! How did I ensure this?
    \item \textbf{
        Desktop only
    } \(\to\) to simplify the development process, the application was only developed for use on desktop
    \item Users can access their library in 3 clicks or less %? Arbitrary amount of clicks | is this necessary
    \item All controls should be intuitive and comfortable to use
\end{itemize} %! What other non-functional requirements do I have?

\section{User Stories}

\section{Activity Network Diagram} %* Effectively a work breakdown structure - lower level than a feature roadmap

\section{UI Wireframes}%* can categorise them by the feature roadmap? Or maybe I can group sections of the roadmap
As one of the key non-functional requirements is for the developed features to integrate into existing streaming applications, the UI was designed using Spotify's desktop interface as an inspiration.
