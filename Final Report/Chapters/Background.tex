\chapter{Background}
Here we will have a systematic literature review of the prior
approaches to this problem.

And some more definitions and explanation

\section{Song Similarity}
There has been lots of research into analysing song similarity by performing analysis on the audio itself. This leads to extractable features that can then be used to compare songs to find their \textbf{sonic distance}\begin{itemize}
    \item low-level \(\to\) 
    \item mid-level \(\to\) 
    \item high-level \(\to\) 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{EchoNest's Music Database}
One of the most prominent cases of this is the EchoNest Music Database.

This is primarily fueled by streaming services need to suggest similar songs for the user to listen to.

Once the user has found the songs the like, they need a way of listening to it easily again.

There does not exist a way to do this in a user-facing way.

This song similarity exists within the proprietary music databases that Big Music don't want you to know/use.

%todo a paragraph mentioning all the websites and tools where data analysis has been done using these attributes (or any others)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exportify's Python Notebooks
    \item 
\end{itemize}
