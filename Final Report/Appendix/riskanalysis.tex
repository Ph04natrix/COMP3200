         Risk&  Severity&  Likelihood&  Risk Exposure& Mitigation Strategy\\ \hline 
         Spotify API deprecates Web Playback SDK&  3&  5&  15& Switch to playing songs locally, accounting for surge in time required\\ \hline 
         Spotify API deprecates core API features being used&  3&  5&  15& Switch to an alternative API, such as Soundcharts to get the same data.\\ \hline 
         Soundcharts API free limit of 500 calls is exceeded&  4&  2&  6& A one month subscription for 500k calls is 140 USD (after a 30\% academic discount) the majority of which is payable under the comp3200 budget\\ \hline 
         Soundcharts deprecates core API features being used&  1&  5&  5& Switch to an alternative dataset/API for the required data. Should none exist or are suitable enough, then implement open-source algorithms to gain the data myself.\\ \hline 
         Falling ill, preventing progress&  2&  2&  4& Make sure to stay physically healthy and always have medicine to hand for a speedy recovery\\ \hline 
         Failing to meet self-made deadlines&  2&  3&  6& Set realistic, achievable deadlines. If needed, reorder work accordingly such that the quality of work is not compromised\\ \hline 
         Loss of communication with supervisor&  1&  3&  3& Plan meetings in advance, make sure to have frequent updates with supervisor so that we are both aware of the current situation\\ \hline 
         Third-party tools (Notion, Overleaf, VScode) going down temporarily&  2&  4&  12& Local backups will be made periodically to ensure progress isnâ€™t fully lost.\\ \hline 
         Third-party tools become unusable for extended period of time&  1&  5&  5& Use alternative tools, respectively: Obsidian/Notepad, Notepad/VScode, Notepad. Notepad is chosen as the final fall-back as it is the most reliable.\\ \hline
         Code being lost/corrupted& 3& 5& 15& Make frequent backups, also using code versioning to allow for safe rollbacks.\\ \hline
         Loss of (progress) report& 2& 5& 10& As above, make frequent backups.\\ \hline
         Loss of key API credentials& 1& 4& 4& Store API credential info in multiple separate places, and if needed request new keys.\\ \hline
